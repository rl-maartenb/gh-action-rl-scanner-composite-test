# ReversingLabs GitHub Action: rl-scanner-composite

ReversingLabs provides officially supported GitHub Actions for faster and easier deployment of the `rl-secure` solution in CI/CD workflows.

The `rl-scanner-composite` action uses the official [reversinglabs/rl-scanner](https://hub.docker.com/r/reversinglabs/rl-scanner) Docker image to scan a single build artifact with `rl-secure`, generate the analysis report, display the analysis status as one of the checks in the GitHub interface, and return the exit status message.
The action also displays the SARIF report in a custom *Rl-Secure-Scanner* section of the Security tab in the GitHub repository.

This action is most suitable for users who want to quickly set up a working security scanning solution.
If you already manage workflows for different purposes and want to integrate security scanning as a step under specific conditions, try the [rl-scanner-only](https://github.com/reversinglabs/gh-action-rl-scanner-only) GitHub Action by ReversingLabs.

Compared to `rl-scanner-only`, this action is more convenient out-of-the-box because it scans the artifact and uploads reports all at once. 
In the `rl-scanner-only` action, everything except the scan has to be provided by the user creating the workflow.


## What is rl-secure?

`rl-secure` is a CLI tool that's part of the [secure.software platform](https://www.secure.software/) - a new ReversingLabs solution for software supply chain protection.

With `rl-secure`, you can:

- Scan your software release packages on-premises and in your CI/CD pipelines to prevent threats from reaching production.
- Compare package versions to ensure no vulnerabilities are introduced in the open source libraries and third-party components you use.
- Prevent private keys, tokens, credentials and other sensitive information from leaking into production.
- Improve developer experience and ensure compliance with security best practices.
- Generate actionable analysis reports to help you prioritize and remediate issues in collaboration with your DevOps and security teams.


## How this action works

The `rl-scanner-composite` action relies on a few different [contexts](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts) to access and reuse information across its steps, and on the following external actions:

- **ouzi-dev/commit-status-updater**
- **actions/upload-artifact**
- **github/codeql-action/upload-sarif**


This action expects that the build artifact is produced in the current workspace before the action is called.
It requires specifying the path of the artifact as the input to the action.
The path must be relative to the `github.workspace`.

Optionally, users can specify the report directory name.
If it is specified, the action saves all supported analysis report formats for the artifact into the report directory.
The path must be relative to the `github.workspace`.

If the report directory name is not specified, the action saves the analysis reports into the default directory. 

When called, the action runs the following steps:

- Set the commit status to pending
- Pull the latest version of the `reversinglabs/rl-scanner` Docker image and scan the build artifact inside a container
- Upload the analysis report to GitHub as `report-sha`, where `sha` corresponds to the SHA identifier of the commit or PR that triggered the action. This makes the report names unique and helps relate them to specific commits if necessary
- Upload the SARIF report file as `report.sarif.json ` to the report directory
- Change the commit status from pending to success/failure depending on the scan result with a descriptive message
- Return the exit status. This allows controlling any subsequent or dependent tasks; for example, blocking the merge if the status is not "success" 


## Requirements

1. **A valid rl-secure license with site key**. If you don't already have a site-wide deployment license, follow the instructions in [the official rl-secure documentation](https://docs.secure.software/cli/deployment/rl-deploy-quick-start#prepare-the-license-and-site-key) to get it from ReversingLabs. You don't need to activate the license - just save the license file and the site key for later use. You must convert your license file into a Base64-encoded string to use it with the Docker image.

2. **Your rl-secure license information added as secrets** to your GitHub organization or repository. Use predefined [environment variables](#environment-variables) to provide the secrets to the action.


**Note for GitHub Enterprise users:** GitHub Actions must be enabled and appropriately configured for the repository where you want to use this action. If you don't have access to the [repository settings](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository), contact your GitHub organization administrators for help.


## Environment variables

This action requires the `rl-secure` license data to be passed via the environment using the following environment variables.


| Environment variable | Description |
| :--------- | :------ |
| `RLSECURE_ENCODED_LICENSE` | Required. The `rl-secure` license file as a Base64-encoded string. Users must encode the contents of your license file, and provide the resulting string with this variable. |
| `RLSECURE_SITE_KEY` | Required. The `rl-secure` license site key. The site key is a string generated by ReversingLabs and sent to users with the license file. |


ReversingLabs strongly recommends following best security practices and [defining these secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#using-encrypted-secrets-in-a-workflow
) on the level of your GitHub organization or repository.


## How to use this GitHub Action

The most common use-case for this action is to add it to the "test" stage in a workflow, after the build artifact has been created.

To use the `rl-secure` security scanning functionality, a valid site-wide deployment license is required. 
This type of license has two parts: the site key and the license file.
ReversingLabs sends both parts of the license to users on request.
Users must then encode the license file with the Base64 algorithm.
The Base64-encoded license string and the site key must be provided to the action using [environment variables](#environment-variables). 


### Inputs

| Input parameter | Required | Description | 
| :--------- | :------ | :------ |
| `artifact-to-scan` | Yes | The software package (build artifact) you want to scan. Provide the artifact file path relative to the `github.workspace` | 
| `ref-sha` | No | The SHA identifier of the commit or pull request associated with the trigger event. Default value is `${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha || github.sha }}`. For most workflows, you do not need to change the default value. | 
| `report-path` | No | The directory where the action will store analysis reports for the build artifact. The directory must be empty. Provide the directory path relative to the `github.workspace`. Default value is `MyReportDir` | 


### Outputs 

| Output parameter | Description | 
| :--------- | :------ |
| `description` | The result of the action - a string terminating in FAIL or PASS. | 
| `status` | The single-word status (as is used by the GitHub Status API), representing the result of the action. It can be any of the following: success, failure, error. **Success** indicates that the resulting string contains PASS. **Failure** indicates the resulting string contains FAIL. **Error** indicates that something went wrong during the scan and the action was not able to retrieve the resulting string. | 

### Artifacts

The action creates: 

- a report directory in `${{ inputs.report-path }}` and a ZIP file named `report-${{ inputs.ref-sha }}` that contains analysis reports. Users can control the `report-path` as an input parameter

- a SARIF report file in `${{ inputs.report-path }}` named `report.sarif.json`


## Examples

The following example is a basic GitHub workflow that runs on pull requests (PRs) and commit pushes to the `main` branch in your repository.

The workflow checks out your repository, builds an artifact, and uses the `rl-scanner-composite` GitHub action to scan the artifact with `rl-secure`.

When the scan is done, analysis results are displayed in the GitHub interface, the reports are uploaded to GitHub, and the SARIF report is displayed in the list of checks. 


```
name: ReversingLabs Rl-Scanner
run-name: ReversingLabs rl-scanner

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

    permissions:
      statuses: write
      pull-requests: write
      # The next 3 permissions are used for SARIF report upload
      security-events: write

    steps:
      # Need to check out data before we can do anything
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Replace this with your build process
      # Need to produce one file as the build artifact in scanfile=<relative file path>
      - name: Create the build artifact
        id: build
 
        shell: bash
 
        run: |
          # Prepare the build process
          python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install example
          python3 -m pip install --upgrade build
          # Run the build
          python3 -m build
          # Produce a single artifact to scan and set the scanfile output parameter
          echo "scanfile=$( ls dist/*.whl )" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
      
      # Use the rl-scanner-composite action
      - name: Scan the build artifact
        id: rl-scan

        env:
          RLSECURE_ENCODED_LICENSE: ${{ secrets.RLSECURE_ENCODED_LICENSE }}
          RLSECURE_SITE_KEY: ${{ secrets.RLSECURE_SITE_KEY }}

        uses: reversinglabs/gh-action-rl-scanner-composite@v1.0.2

        with:
          artifact-to-scan: ${{ steps.build.outputs.scanfile }}
          report-path: "My_Report_Dir"
```
